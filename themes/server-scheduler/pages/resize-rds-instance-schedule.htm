        <p>Server Scheduler provides a visual time grid to automatically <strong>resize RDS instances at scheduled</strong> times throughout the week.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>If you have predictable traffic patterns, simply choose the times you want your instances to scale up or down, the size you want to go to and Server Scheduler will handle the entire resize process automatically.</p>

        <h2 id="h2-1.1">How Scheduled RDS Resizing Works</h2>
        <p>Server Scheduler integrates with the AWS RDS API to handle instance resizing safely and reliably. Using the API key you provide, our system automatically stops running instances, modifies the instance type, and restarts them according to your predefined schedule. There will be a brief period of downtime while this is happening but this is usually 1-2 minutes and is linked to the size of your database.</p>
        <img src="https://imagedelivery.net/k0P4EcPiouU_XzyGSmgmUw/986e126d-d4e4-4421-634b-5c176e26fd00/public" alt="" class="rounded-lg  mx-auto">
        <br/>

        <h2 id="h2-2">Why Resize RDS Instance On Schedule In AWS</h2>
        <p>Many applications have predictable usage patterns where they need more compute power during business hours and can run on smaller instances during off-peak times, saving up to 70% on costs. A good example is test environments that are not used after everyone finishes work for the day. Manually resizing instances is time-consuming and easy to forget. This is where Server Scheduler comes in with an easy to use time grid to set the time, size and family of instance you want to change to. </p>
        <br/>

        <img src="https://imagedelivery.net/k0P4EcPiouU_XzyGSmgmUw/51bdba7c-6b56-40d6-b3fe-0f1fceaadc00/public" width="500" alt="" class="rounded-lg  mx-auto">
        <br/>

        <h2 id="h2-3">What About Autoscaling</h2>
        <p>Autoscaling is the most common way for applications to scale if you can deal with the trade offs. It can be tricky to set up and costs can quickly spiral if a flood of traffic comes. The scaling is out of your control and is determined by your users. Our experience is that it is particularly challenging with RDS and often it can be less headache to have large instance running over provisioned rather than wasting springs of engineering time trying to implement autoscaling.</p>
    	<p>Server Scheduler offers precision by allowing devops engineers to determine exactly when an applications RDS servers should scale and by how much. When you have predictable traffic patterns it makes more sense to put guard rails on the scaling windows and that is made possible with our time grid.</p>


        <br/>
        <p>Automated resizing ensures your RDS instances are always sized appropriately for the current workload demands, maximizing performance during peak hours while minimizing costs during low-usage periods.</p>
    

        <h2 id="h2-4">Features of Server Scheduler</h2>
        <p>Server Scheduler goes beyond basic RDS resizing functionality. The platform understands the complexities of instance management and provides features specifically designed for DevOps teams and system administrators.</p>

        <h2 id="h2-6">Enterprise Instance Management</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Large organizations appreciate how Server Scheduler integrates RDS resize scheduling with comprehensive team management. System administrators can set up resize schedules while giving read-only access to developers who need visibility into infrastructure scaling.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-6">The audit logging captures every resize operation with detailed timestamps and user attribution, making it easy to track scaling activities for compliance reporting and cost optimization analysis.</p>
        
        <h2 id="h2-7">Safety and Reliability</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">RDS instance resizing requires careful handling to prevent data loss or service disruption. Server Scheduler implements multiple safety checks to ensure your scheduled resize operations happen smoothly without issues.</p>
        
        <div class="bg-red-50 border border-red-200 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-red-900">Built-in Safety Measures</h3>
            <p class="text-red-800 mb-3">Our system only resizes instances that are currently stopped, automatically stopping running instances first and restarting them after the resize completes. This ensures zero data loss during the process.</p>
            <p class="text-red-800">Comprehensive error handling ensures that failed resize attempts are logged with detailed error messages, and automatic retry logic handles transient AWS API issues without manual intervention.</p>
        </div>


        <h2 id="h2-8">Integration with Complete Infrastructure</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">What sets Server Scheduler apart is how RDS resize scheduling integrates with your entire AWS infrastructure management. You can coordinate instance resizing with EC2 scaling and Elasticache cache cluster management from a single platform.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-6">This unified approach means you can ensure databases are scaled in sync with EC2 and cache servers, or schedule cache optimization to coincide with compute scaling for maximum efficiency during peak periods.</p>

        <h2 id="h2-9">Real-World Cost Savings</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Development teams using Server Scheduler report 40-70% cost reductions on their RDS spend by automatically scaling down during off-hours. Production environments see improved performance during peak times while maintaining cost efficiency during low-usage periods.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-6">The consistency of automated resizing also makes it easier to predict and budget AWS costs, helping teams optimize their cloud spending over time with data-driven scaling decisions.</p>

        <h2 id="h2-10">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <br/>
        <p><strong>Q: How To add memory to an RDS instance?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Memory is tied to the instance type, so the way to increase RAM is by changing the instance type to one with more memory. For a one time change, do it manually in the AWS Dashboard </p>
        <br/>

        <p><strong>Q: Can we change RDS instance type while running</strong></p>
        <p>A: No. Unfortunately instances will be unavailable during the resize. If downtime is not an option, you will need to create a new instance at the desired size and repoint your application to that.</p>
        <br/>

        <p><strong>Q: How To Resize RDS instance on schedule in AWS?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Connect Server Scheduler to AWS and then choose the time you want your RDS to be resized </p>
        <br/>

        <p><strong>Q: How to upgrade RDS instance OS?</strong></p>
        <p>A: Upgrading an existing server is possible but we highly recommend creating a new instance with the desired OS version.</p>
