<p class="text-sm text-slate-500 mb-8">Last updated: May 25, 2025</p>

<p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") govern your relationship with <a href="https://serverscheduler.com" class="text-indigo-600 underline">https://serverscheduler.com</a> website (the "Service") operated by Leader Internet Limited ("us", "we", or "our").</p>

<p>Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using the Service.</p>

<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>

<p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Subscriptions</h2>
<p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Leader Internet Limited cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Leader Internet Limited customer support team.</p>
<p>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Leader Internet Limited with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Leader Internet Limited to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
<p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Leader Internet Limited will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Free Trial</h2>
<p>Leader Internet Limited may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").</p>
<p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>
<p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by Leader Internet Limited until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>
<p>At any time and without notice, Leader Internet Limited reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Fee Changes</h2>
<p>Leader Internet Limited, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
<p>Leader Internet Limited will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
<p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Refunds</h2>
<p>Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Leader Internet Limited on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of Leader Internet Limited.</p>
